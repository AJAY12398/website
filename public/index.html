<h3>Control your Content</h3>

<p>Online content authoring isn't a solved problem. You might go with an
HTML-based editor, and hope it gives you the kind of HTML you want. Or
you might go with a text-based markup format, and hope your users
understand how to use it.</p>

<p>ProseMirror aims to improve that situation by providing a drop-in
editor component with a rigid semantic document model, that can be
customized to fit your application. By default, it exposes
the <a href="http://commonmark.org">CommonMark</a> (Markdown) document
model, but you can restrict that and/or add your own kinds of
elements.</p>

<p>By strictly separating its document data structure from the browser's
DOM, ProseMirror sidesteps most of the mess that is
<code>contentEditable</code>, and ensures that the document stays
entirely under the control of the editor.</p>

<h3>Collaborate</h3>

<p>ProseMirror represents changes to documents as well-defined pieces of
data. Such changes can be stored, inverted (for undo), analyzed (think
<code>git blame</code>), and filtered (to implement more complex types
of content restriction).</p>

<p>And most importantly, they can be sent over the wire to implement
real-time collaborative editing. The library solves the hard problems
(see <a
href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing.html">this
writeup</a>), and you can simply wire it up to your transport of
choice (think long-polling or websockets). You can see this in action
in <a href="demo_collab.html">our demo</a>.</p>

<h3>Integrate and Extend</h3>

<p>ProseMirror is implemented as a set of
clean <a href="http://babeljs.io">ES6</a> modules. I was able to apply
much of my editor-implementing experience (as the author
of <a href="http://codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a>) to make this editor
fast, robust, and open to extension.</p>

<p>The codebase was written with extendability in mind. ProseMirror
adjusts to your site, not the other way around. External code can
extend the document model, attach event handlers, register new
options, trigger editing actions, and so on.</p>

<h3>Status</h3>

<p>ProseMirror is intended to become open source (MIT licenced), but
since I need to combine writing open software and earning a living, I
am running
a <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prosemirror/">crowd-funding
campaign</a> to fund the work I put into the implementation. Until
that succeeds, all rights are reserved.</p>

<p>The library is in <strong>beta</strong> status. It works, as the
demos can attest, but there are without doubt a lot of wrinkles left
that need to be ironed out with real-world testing.</p>

<p>Curious? Play with <a href="demo_basic.html">some demos</a>, or

the <a href="https://github.com/prosemirror/prosemirror">source
code</a>.</p>
