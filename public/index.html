<p><strong>Rich text, modernized</strong>: Have your users edit
documents with all the styling and structuring found in
Markdown/<a href="http://commonmark.org">CommonMark</a> using a
simple, easily learnable interface. <span class=subtle>(Different
document models will be supported in the future.)</span></p>

<p><strong>Edit prose, not HTML</strong>. ProseMirror completely
detaches its document model from HTML, resulting in a simple,
predictable editing experience and clean, portable output.</p>

<p><strong>Collaborate</strong>. Broadcast changes to peers editing
the same document. Support for real-time collaboration is built into
the library.</p>

<p><strong>Extend</strong>.
Like <a href="http://codemirror.net">CodeMirror</a>, ProseMirror is
designed to be a flexible <em>component</em>, allowing sites to add
and replace functionality through a rich programming API.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>ProseMirror is intended to become open source (MIT licenced), but
since I need to somehow combine writing open software and earning a
living, I am running a <a href="XXX">crowd-funding campaign</a> to
fund the work I did on this system. Until that succeeds, all rights
are reserved.</p>

<p>The library is in beta status. It works, as the demo below can
attest, but there are without doubt a lot of wrinkles left that need
to be found through real-world use.</p>

<section id="demo">

<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>I have set up a simple collaborative editing service to showcase
both the editing experience and the collaborative aspect. You can
create or join a document, and edit it along with other people looking
at the same document.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Firstly, since this demo is open for
everybody, you might run into people typing stupid, mean, and
disgusting things. Try not to be such a person. Secondly, this is a
quickly hacked together demo on top of a beta-quality software
component. It is likely to crash and lose all its data on a regular
interval. Don't use it for anything serious.</p>

  <h1>Using ProseMirror</h1>

  <p>This is editable text. Focus it and start typing.</p>

  <p>To apply styling, you can select a piece of text and manipulate
  its styling from the tooltip menu. You
  get <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>strong
  text</strong>, <a href="http://XXX">links</a>, <code>code
  font</code>, and <img src="img.png"> images.</p>

  <p>Block-level structure is manipulated through the “hamburger” menu
  to the right of the selected paragraph. This allows you to change
  paragraphs into headers or code blocks, to wrap them in lists or
  blockquotes, to unwrap them, and to insert things like horizontal
  rules.</p>

  <p>Try using the "indent” item in the menu to wrap this paragraph in
  a numbered list.</p>

  <p>And turn this paragraph into a code block.</p>

  <p>When editing a collaborative document, this demo adds an
  annotation feature, which is also available from the selection menu.
  Annotated text shows up yellow. Put your cursor on it to see what it
  says.</p>

  <p>To start playing with collaborative editing, select an instance
  ID from the input field above the editor.</p>
